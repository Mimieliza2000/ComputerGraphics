Time it took to complete this assignment: 45+

I spent too much time searching up how to make my waves happen which is why it took me way longer that I know it shows. Although, I am very happy and content of how much I learned and what I was able to do. This class came to be more difficult for me, but I was happy with I created with the tv, lights, and my textures. I made sure to hit all my feedbacks and added textures and lighting to my cylinders and spheres instead of just my cube objects.

I would say I deserve a B+ because I know I did not use my time wisely when I spend a lot of time trying to figure out something I did not end up using. I did, however, made sure my textures look as crips as possible and had my first person and lighting work out. I know I could have done better with the amount of time given and I have been going through a lot of problems personally but I know we all do and I do not want to use that as an excuse. Thank you for an amazing semster.
